# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
Using Python, this project audits the results of a congressional election to confirm the winner. The data input for the analysis is a CSV file that contains three pieces of information per row (Ballot ID, County, & Selected Candidate). We have been asked to count the ballots to report on the number of votes each candidate received and confirm the winner of the election. In addition to this information, additional information will also be provided such as voter turnout.
